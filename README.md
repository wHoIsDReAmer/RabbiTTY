# Rabbitty

> Warn: This is a work-in-progress project.

Rabbitty is a terminal emulator chasing `foot`-like memory thrift and cross-platform speed, with feature-ful and polish.

- Lean memory: small, steady footprint even with deep scrollback.
- Fast paths: low-latency rendering and input.
- Cross-platform: consistent on macOS, Linux, Windows.
- Featureful and fancy: tabs, themes, and modern UX without bloat.

## Supported-OS

- Mac (tested)
- Windows 11 (tested)
- Linux (not tested)
